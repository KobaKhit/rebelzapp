# Final Cleanup - Removed Outdated Warning

## What Was Removed

The yellow warning banner in the AI Chat page:

```
⚠️ AG-UI Mode: This feature requires the backend SSE endpoint to be deployed. 
You may see connection errors until deployment is complete.
```

## Why It Was Removed

This warning was added during development when the SSE endpoint wasn't deployed yet. Now that:

✅ Backend SSE endpoint is deployed (`/ai/events`)
✅ Nginx is properly configured for SSE
✅ CopilotKit endpoint is working (`/api/copilotkit`)
✅ No console errors for AG-UI or CopilotKit

The warning is **no longer needed** and was just confusing users.

## What Changed

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/AIChat.tsx`

**Before:**
- Yellow warning banner displayed when AG-UI enabled
- Suggested switching to standard chat
- Made it seem like feature wasn't ready

**After:**
- Warning removed
- Clean UI
- Feature works perfectly

## User Experience Improvement

Users will now see:
- ✅ Clean interface without unnecessary warnings
- ✅ AG-UI toggle works immediately
- ✅ CopilotKit toggle works immediately
- ✅ Professional appearance
